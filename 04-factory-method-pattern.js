// factory method is useful in:
// applications that manage, maintain, or manipulate collections of objects that are different but at the same time have many characteristics(i.e.methods and properties) in common.

// e.g.
// obstacle factory in a space invaders game, which takes a parameter of whatever level your on and then systemically creates different obstacles(asteroids, alienships, and monsters - each of which is its own factory, systemically varying the speed, size, direction, and position of the obstacles it generates)
// tetris pieces(can have a mechanism which balances out which pieces are created so its not too many of one type at once, can also vary their orientation etc. )
