Strategy:
    encapsulates algorithms within classes and makes them interchangable. 
    allows for more flexibility at runtime 
    favours composition over inheritance 

Observable: 
    allows notifying and updating a bunch of observables when an observer updates

Decorator:
    allows wrapping objects to augment their behaviours/properties
    prevents class explosion 

Simple factory:
    encapsulates object creation (keeps things neat)

Factory method:
    same as above, but allows subclasses to group what objects get created (into families)

Abstract factory:
    same as above, but uses multiple factory methods

Singleton:
    ensures a class only gets instantiated once

Command:
    encapsulates a request, good for keeping logs of actions
    supports undo operations

Adapter:
    provides a way to make two incompatible interfaces compatible
    useful when using libraries that may change, deprecation etc.

Facade:
    provides a simplified interface to talk to a whole system
    adheres to the 'speak only to your immediate friends' principle

Template method:
    encapsulates part of an algorithm to subclasses
    useful for creating hooks and abstract operations

Iterator:
    provides a way to iterate over similar classes that use different collections (e.g. array, array-lists, hash-tables etc.) without having to know what collections they're using.
    keeps things neat
