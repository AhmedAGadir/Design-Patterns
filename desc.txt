Strategy:
    encapsulates algorithms within classes and makes them interchangable. 
    allows for more flexibility at runtime and for code reuse across classes
    favours composition over inheritance 

Observable: 
    allows notifying and updating a bunch of observables when an observer updates

Decorator:
    allows wrapping objects to augment, add to, or block access to their behaviours/properties
    prevents class explosion 

Simple factory:
    encapsulates object creation (keeps things neat) 

Factory method:
    same as above, but allows subclasses to group what objects get created (into families)

Abstract factory:
    same as above, but uses multiple factory methods

Singleton:
    ensures a class only gets instantiated once

Command:
    encapsulates a request, good for keeping logs of actions
    supports undo operations

Adapter:
    provides a way to make two incompatible interfaces compatible
    useful when using libraries that may change, deprecation etc.

Facade:
    provides a simplified interface to talk to a whole system
    adheres to the 'speak only to your immediate friends' principle

Template method:
    encapsulates part of an algorithm to subclasses
    useful for creating hooks and abstract operations

Iterator:
    provides a way to iterate over similar classes that use different collections (e.g. array, array-lists, hash-tables etc.) without having to know what collections they're using.
    keeps things neat

Composite:
    provides a way to treat object and composites of objects uniformly 
    (combos well with iterator pattern)

Null:
    instead of returning null, and having to do checks in your code, sometimes you can create a Null Object which does implements an interface, but does nothing.
    e.g. null iterator - see HFDP page 380.

State:
    Allows an object to alter its behaviour when its internal state changes
    much better alternative than a bunch of if-else statements in methods depending on state

Proxy: 
    provides a placeholder for another object in order to control access to it.
    useful for protection and if object creation is expensive
