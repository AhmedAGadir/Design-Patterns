DEFINITIONS:

Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

Encapsulates algorithms within classes, making them interchangable and more reusable 

***** useful when: ***** 
* you want to use different variants of an algorithm within an object and be able to switch from one algorithm to another during runtime.
* you have a lot of similar classes that only differ in the way they execute some behavior.
* to isolate the business logic of a class from the implementation details of algorithms that may not be as important in the context of that logic.
* your class has a massive conditional operator that switches between different variants of the same algorithm.

note: the different strategies are normally set on the clients constructor or using some kind of setter
