abstract classes cant be instantiated 
abstract methods must be specified in subclasses
public properties/methods can be accessed from outside
private properties/methods can only be accessed from methods within the same class
protected props/methods can be only be accessed from methods within the same class AND from subclasses
static methods can be accessed directly on the class (without any instantiation)
'final' means whats prop/method specified can not be overridden in subclasses
'void' returns nothing
