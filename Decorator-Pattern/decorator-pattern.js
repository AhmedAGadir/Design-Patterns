// DEFINITION
// Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing
//  for extending functionality.

// The Decorator pattern extends (decorates) an object’s behavior dynamically. The ability to add new behavior at runtime
// is accomplished by a Decorator object which ‘wraps itself’ around the original object. Multiple decorators can add or 
// override functionality to the original object.

// An example of a decorator is security management where business objects are given additional access to privileged 
// information depending on the privileges of the authenticated user. For example, an HR manager gets to work with an
//  employee object that has appended (i.e. is decorated with) the employee's salary record so that salary information
//  can be viewed.

// Decorators provide flexibility to statically typed languages by allowing runtime changes as opposed to inheritance
//  which takes place at compile time. JavaScript, however, is a dynamic language and the ability to extend an object
//  at runtime is baked into the language itself.

// For this reason, the Decorator pattern is less relevant to JavaScript developers. In JavaScript the Extend and 
// Mixin patterns subsume the Decorator pattern.

// ***** useful when: *****
// you want to wrap your components with additional functioanlity where you can return/augment/block component behaviour multiple decorators can wrap a component, each of which introducing completely different effects
// it’s awkward or not possible to extend an object’s behavior using inheritance.

// note: the decorator IS a component, but it also HAS a component
