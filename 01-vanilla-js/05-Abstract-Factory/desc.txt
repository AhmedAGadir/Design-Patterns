DEFININTION
Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependant objects without specifying their concrete classes

an abstract factory makes use of multiple factory methods

the diference between abstract factory and factory method is that factory method constructs single products
while the abstract factory constructs multiple products

this ones good when you have sets of products that don't really make sense to mix and match 

e.g. 

UI CONTROLS

macOS [x, y] 
linux [i, j]
windows [a, b]

it doesnt make sense to mix x (a mac os button) with b (a windows checkbox)
