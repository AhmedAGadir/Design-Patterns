Factory Method Pattern:
A creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

***** useful when: ***** 
in applications that manage, maintain, or manipulate collections of objects that are different but at the same time have many characteristics in common.
A class cannot anticipate the type of objects it needs to create beforehand.
A class requires its subclasses to specify the objects it creates.
You want to localize the logic to instantiate a complex object.
you're seeing a lot of if statements for object creation in your code
