Definition:
Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you paramatize other objects with different requests, que or log requests. And support undoable operations 

Encapsulates a request (i.e. a command), we're not about to encapsulate the receiver of the request, or the sender of the request, were encapsulating the actual request

• the invoker - invokes a given command 
• when the command is invoked it invokes a method(s) on a receiver 

note:
(1) you can keep a log of commands which will be easy to undo, as every command has an unexecute method
e.g. think of the photoshop app, a log of commands executed on the canvas can be kept, and when users want to undo actions, it's very simple (just call unexecute on the command)
(2) you can construct macro commands i.e. commands that contain multiple executions
